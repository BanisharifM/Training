- [Adam] Congratulations
on completing this course.

2
00:00:03.02 --> 00:00:05.06
Now that you've seen the
basics of using TensorFlow,

3
00:00:05.06 --> 00:00:08.04
you can try applying it
to your own projects.

4
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:10.04
You might also want to check out Keras,

5
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:12.05
a wrapper library for TensorFlow.

6
00:00:12.05 --> 00:00:15.09
It makes many common operations
in TensorFlow a lot easier.

7
00:00:15.09 --> 00:00:18.06

1
00:00:00.08 --> 00:00:02.00
- [Instructor] Now that
we have created the

2
00:00:02.00 --> 00:00:05.00
cloud based machine learning
model, let's put it to use.

3
00:00:05.00 --> 00:00:07.08
If you haven't already
created the cloud based model,

4
00:00:07.08 --> 00:00:10.09
please review the previous
video before continuing.

5
00:00:10.09 --> 00:00:12.07
In this video, we'll learn how to call

6
00:00:12.07 --> 00:00:15.03
our machine learning model
from a Python program.

7
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:17.06
But you can also use
the same approach to use

8
00:00:17.06 --> 00:00:19.04
cloud based machine learning models

9
00:00:19.04 --> 00:00:21.08
in programs not written in Python.

10
00:00:21.08 --> 00:00:25.01
Google provides implementations
of its API client library

11
00:00:25.01 --> 00:00:27.02
for many popular programming languages.

12
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:32.05
Let's take a look at
developers.google.com/apiclientlibrary

13
00:00:32.05 --> 00:00:35.06
and let's scroll down to
the supported languages.

14
00:00:35.06 --> 00:00:37.02
You can call Google services from

15
00:00:37.02 --> 00:00:38.09
any of these languages, using the same

16
00:00:38.09 --> 00:00:41.02
basic approach we'll use here.

17
00:00:41.02 --> 00:00:43.05
Just check the documentation
and code samples

18
00:00:43.05 --> 00:00:45.05
provided by Google, to see how the syntax

19
00:00:45.05 --> 00:00:47.00
varies for each language.

20
00:00:47.00 --> 00:00:50.03
Okay, let's get started,
to use a cloud based

21
00:00:50.03 --> 00:00:52.05
machine learning model
from another program,

22
00:00:52.05 --> 00:00:55.05
we need two things, first, we need access

23
00:00:55.05 --> 00:00:57.06
to make calls to the cloud.

24
00:00:57.06 --> 00:00:59.07
For this, we need a credentials file.

25
00:00:59.07 --> 00:01:01.05
This file keeps our cloud based

26
00:01:01.05 --> 00:01:03.06
service secure from unauthorized use.

27
00:01:03.06 --> 00:01:05.06
Second, we need to write the code

28
00:01:05.06 --> 00:01:07.09
to call our cloud based model, for that,

29
00:01:07.09 --> 00:01:11.07
we'll use the Google
cloud API client library.

30
00:01:11.07 --> 00:01:13.09
Let's set up the credentials file.

31
00:01:13.09 --> 00:01:16.02
In your web browser, open
up the Google console,

32
00:01:16.02 --> 00:01:20.04
at console.cloud.google.com,
if you aren't already

33
00:01:20.04 --> 00:01:22.07
logged in, just log back in and then,

34
00:01:22.07 --> 00:01:24.09
double check on the toolbar, to make sure

35
00:01:24.09 --> 00:01:27.02
you have the correct project selected.

36
00:01:27.02 --> 00:01:29.02
Now in the menu, we're going to look at

37
00:01:29.02 --> 00:01:32.06
API manager and then, credentials.

38
00:01:32.06 --> 00:01:35.02
Then on the dropdown menu
next to create credentials,

39
00:01:35.02 --> 00:01:39.00
we're going to choose service account key.

40
00:01:39.00 --> 00:01:42.07
Here, we need to choose
which service account to use.

41
00:01:42.07 --> 00:01:44.00
We're going to use the default

42
00:01:44.00 --> 00:01:45.08
service account for convenience.

43
00:01:45.08 --> 00:01:47.04
But you can also create
a new service account

44
00:01:47.04 --> 00:01:51.06
with limited permissions if
you're concerned about security.

45
00:01:51.06 --> 00:01:54.07
Now, click create.

46
00:01:54.07 --> 00:01:58.04
The credentials file will be
downloaded to your computer.

47
00:01:58.04 --> 00:02:00.04
Let's look at the file on our computer,

48
00:02:00.04 --> 00:02:04.05
show in finder, and now,
let's rename this file.

49
00:02:04.05 --> 00:02:06.06
I'm going to right click and choose rename

50
00:02:06.06 --> 00:02:10.08
and then call it, credentials.json,
just to make it simple.

51
00:02:10.08 --> 00:02:14.00
Now I'm going to copy
this file into PyCharm

52
00:02:14.00 --> 00:02:15.09
by right clicking and choosing copy,

53
00:02:15.09 --> 00:02:19.05
and then going to PyCharm
and then right clicking

54
00:02:19.05 --> 00:02:22.01
on the 06 folder and pasting it,

55
00:02:22.01 --> 00:02:26.01
and then, click okay.

56
00:02:26.01 --> 00:02:28.09
Now, open up call_cloud_service.py.

57
00:02:28.09 --> 00:02:32.07
This file uses the Google
cloud services API client

58
00:02:32.07 --> 00:02:35.00
to make request to our cloud based model.

59
00:02:35.00 --> 00:02:36.09
First, put in your project ID on line five

60
00:02:36.09 --> 00:02:38.09
where it says, change me.

61
00:02:38.09 --> 00:02:40.07
You can check your project ID by

62
00:02:40.07 --> 00:02:42.03
going back to your web browser

63
00:02:42.03 --> 00:02:44.03
and clicking on Google cloud platform,

64
00:02:44.03 --> 00:02:46.04
to go back to the dashboard and then,

65
00:02:46.04 --> 00:02:48.05
looking under project info.

66
00:02:48.05 --> 00:02:51.03
This is my project ID,
I'm going to copy that

67
00:02:51.03 --> 00:02:54.04
and go back to PyCharm and paste that in.

68
00:02:54.04 --> 00:02:57.00
On the next line, make sure the model name

69
00:02:57.00 --> 00:02:59.09
matches the name you use
to create your model.

70
00:02:59.09 --> 00:03:04.04
My model's called, earnings.

71
00:03:04.04 --> 00:03:06.07
Now let's look at line 10, this is where

72
00:03:06.07 --> 00:03:08.08
we put in the data we want to use as input

73
00:03:08.08 --> 00:03:10.05
to our machine learning model.

74
00:03:10.05 --> 00:03:13.04
I've hard coded some example
data here that we can try,

75
00:03:13.04 --> 00:03:16.02
but in the real program,
you might feed in user input

76
00:03:16.02 --> 00:03:17.09
or read this data from a file.

77
00:03:17.09 --> 00:03:20.02
The rest of the code
here, is the minimum code

78
00:03:20.02 --> 00:03:24.00
needed to make request to
the Google cloud ML service.

79
00:03:24.00 --> 00:03:27.01
First, on line 15, we read
the account credentials

80
00:03:27.01 --> 00:03:29.09
from the json file, we
need this to have access

81
00:03:29.09 --> 00:03:32.03
to make a call to the cloud service.

82
00:03:32.03 --> 00:03:35.03
Then, on line 16, we
create the Python object

83
00:03:35.03 --> 00:03:37.07
to connect to the cloud ML service.

84
00:03:37.07 --> 00:03:41.04
Next on line 19, we
format our project name,

85
00:03:41.04 --> 00:03:44.06
into the format that Google expects.

86
00:03:44.06 --> 00:03:47.05
And then, on line 20, we
make a predictionary quest,

87
00:03:47.05 --> 00:03:51.02
where we connect to the service
and send it our input data.

88
00:03:51.02 --> 00:03:53.06
And then, on line 26, we check for errors

89
00:03:53.06 --> 00:03:55.03
and as long as everything looks good,

90
00:03:55.03 --> 00:03:57.07
then on line 30, we get the response.

91
00:03:57.07 --> 00:04:00.00
And finally on line 33,
we print the results.

92
00:04:00.00 --> 00:04:01.08
Now, let's run the code and try it out.

93
00:04:01.08 --> 00:04:06.06
Right click, choose run.

94
00:04:06.06 --> 00:04:08.02
Great, we're able to successfully connect

95
00:04:08.02 --> 00:04:10.02
to our machine learning model in the cloud

96
00:04:10.02 --> 00:04:11.07
and use it to make a prediction.

97
00:04:11.07 --> 00:04:13.05
Now we can call this
machine learning model

98
00:04:13.05 --> 00:04:15.05
from inside of any program we write.

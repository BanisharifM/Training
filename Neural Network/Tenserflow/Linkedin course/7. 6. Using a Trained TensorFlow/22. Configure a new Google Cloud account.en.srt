1
00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:02.00
- [Instructor] To host
machine learning models

2
00:00:02.00 --> 00:00:03.06
on the Google Cloud service

3
00:00:03.06 --> 00:00:05.05
you need to set up your Google account.

4
00:00:05.05 --> 00:00:08.04
We also need to install
the Google Cloud SDK.

5
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:11.00
The Google Cloud SDK contains utilities

6
00:00:11.00 --> 00:00:12.05
that we can use to interact

7
00:00:12.05 --> 00:00:15.05
with the Google Cloud
services from our computer.

8
00:00:15.05 --> 00:00:16.06
First in your browser,

9
00:00:16.06 --> 00:00:22.02
let's go to console.cloud.google.com.

10
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:24.06
Here log in with your Google account.

11
00:00:24.06 --> 00:00:26.00
If you already have a Gmail account

12
00:00:26.00 --> 00:00:28.08
you can use that email
address and password.

13
00:00:28.08 --> 00:00:30.04
If you don't have a Google account

14
00:00:30.04 --> 00:00:34.08
you'll be given the option
to create a new one.

15
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:37.06
This is the Google Cloud
platform dashboard.

16
00:00:37.06 --> 00:00:39.02
From here you can access all

17
00:00:39.02 --> 00:00:41.04
the different Google Cloud services.

18
00:00:41.04 --> 00:00:43.00
If you don't have any projects,

19
00:00:43.00 --> 00:00:45.07
you may see a button that
says create new project.

20
00:00:45.07 --> 00:00:46.09
So you can click that.

21
00:00:46.09 --> 00:00:47.09
If you do have projects,

22
00:00:47.09 --> 00:00:49.08
just click on the project dropdown

23
00:00:49.08 --> 00:00:55.00
and then click plus to
create the new project.

24
00:00:55.00 --> 00:00:59.02
Name your project Tensor Flow Class.

25
00:00:59.02 --> 00:01:01.04
You'll notice that the
project will also get assigned

26
00:01:01.04 --> 00:01:02.07
a unique key like

27
00:01:02.07 --> 00:01:06.04
tensorflowclass170621.

28
00:01:06.04 --> 00:01:08.09
That's the ID you can
use to access the project

29
00:01:08.09 --> 00:01:10.02
from your programs.

30
00:01:10.02 --> 00:01:12.06
Now click create.

31
00:01:12.06 --> 00:01:14.07
And we have to wait until it finishes.

32
00:01:14.07 --> 00:01:16.09
You can watch the progress
in the notifications tray

33
00:01:16.09 --> 00:01:18.09
in the top right.

34
00:01:18.09 --> 00:01:20.07
Great the project's been created.

35
00:01:20.07 --> 00:01:23.03
Since the Google Cloud
platform has so many features,

36
00:01:23.03 --> 00:01:25.05
not all of them are enabled by default.

37
00:01:25.05 --> 00:01:27.06
We need to enable Google
Cloud machine learning

38
00:01:27.06 --> 00:01:29.05
before we can use it.

39
00:01:29.05 --> 00:01:31.08
So click on the main menu on the left,

40
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:35.08
go to API manager, and
then choose library.

41
00:01:35.08 --> 00:01:39.09
This is a list of all the
Google services you can enable.

42
00:01:39.09 --> 00:01:43.03
Look for Google Cloud machine learning.

43
00:01:43.03 --> 00:01:46.00
And under that look for the
machine learning engine API

44
00:01:46.00 --> 00:01:48.06
and click on it.

45
00:01:48.06 --> 00:01:50.01
If you've never used it before,

46
00:01:50.01 --> 00:01:51.08
you'll have to click here to enable it.

47
00:01:51.08 --> 00:01:52.08
If you've already enabled it

48
00:01:52.08 --> 00:01:54.05
you'll see a screen like this.

49
00:01:54.05 --> 00:01:57.02
Finally you need to provide
billing details for your account

50
00:01:57.02 --> 00:02:00.02
before you can use some of
the features of Google Cloud.

51
00:02:00.02 --> 00:02:02.00
To do that, click on the main menu

52
00:02:02.00 --> 00:02:04.04
and then go to the billing section.

53
00:02:04.04 --> 00:02:05.08
You might be offered the free trial

54
00:02:05.08 --> 00:02:07.07
which you can take
advantage if you'd like.

55
00:02:07.07 --> 00:02:10.01
Be aware that you're
responsible for any charges

56
00:02:10.01 --> 00:02:12.07
that you incur on Google Cloud.

57
00:02:12.07 --> 00:02:14.09
Great, now that we've created the project

58
00:02:14.09 --> 00:02:16.05
and enabled the machine learning API's,

59
00:02:16.05 --> 00:02:18.01
the account's ready to go.

60
00:02:18.01 --> 00:02:21.06
The next step is to install
the Google Cloud SDK.

61
00:02:21.06 --> 00:02:24.01
The Google Cloud SDK is a set of tools

62
00:02:24.01 --> 00:02:25.08
that let us work with
the Google Cloud service

63
00:02:25.08 --> 00:02:27.04
from our computer.

64
00:02:27.04 --> 00:02:28.09
To do that, let's go to the

65
00:02:28.09 --> 00:02:34.06
cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads.

66
00:02:34.06 --> 00:02:38.01
On this page you'll be given
several installation options.

67
00:02:38.01 --> 00:02:40.08
Choose the option for run
the interactive installer

68
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:44.04
to download and install
the latest release.

69
00:02:44.04 --> 00:02:47.07
This will give you directions
for Mac and for Windows.

70
00:02:47.07 --> 00:02:49.09
The directions are
different for each platform,

71
00:02:49.09 --> 00:02:54.02
follow the instructions for
your platform to install it.

72
00:02:54.02 --> 00:02:56.04
Once you have the Google
Cloud SDK installed,

73
00:02:56.04 --> 00:02:59.06
we need to activate it by
logging in from the command line.

74
00:02:59.06 --> 00:03:01.08
Open up the command line
window in your computer

75
00:03:01.08 --> 00:03:08.05
and in that window type
gcloud init and hit enter.

76
00:03:08.05 --> 00:03:10.03
Now the Google Cloud SDK will attempt

77
00:03:10.03 --> 00:03:12.07
to open a web browser window
to the Google login page

78
00:03:12.07 --> 00:03:14.03
when we hit enter.

79
00:03:14.03 --> 00:03:17.08
Choose the correct account
and then click Allow.

80
00:03:17.08 --> 00:03:19.01
Once you see this message

81
00:03:19.01 --> 00:03:21.09
you are now authenticated
with the Google Cloud SDK,

82
00:03:21.09 --> 00:03:24.00
everything is ready to go.

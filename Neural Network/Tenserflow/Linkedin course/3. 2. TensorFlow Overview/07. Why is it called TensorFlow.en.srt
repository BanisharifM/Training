00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.08
- [Teacher] Alright, what's with the name?

2
00:00:02.08 --> 00:00:06.05
The name TensorFlow comes
from the design of the system.

3
00:00:06.05 --> 00:00:09.06
TensorFlow is designed to
work with large data sets

4
00:00:09.06 --> 00:00:13.00
made up of many different
individual attributes.

5
00:00:13.00 --> 00:00:15.07
Any data that you want to
process with TensorFlow

6
00:00:15.07 --> 00:00:18.06
has to be stored in the
multi-dimensional array.

7
00:00:18.06 --> 00:00:22.01
These multi-dimensional arrays
are also called tensors.

8
00:00:22.01 --> 00:00:24.02
To run operations on the data set,

9
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:26.04
you construct a computational graph

10
00:00:26.04 --> 00:00:28.01
similar to a flow chart

11
00:00:28.01 --> 00:00:30.00
that determines how data flows

12
00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:31.09
from one operation to the next.

13
00:00:31.09 --> 00:00:33.04
So it's called TensorFlow

14
00:00:33.04 --> 00:00:36.01
because you're defining
how data or tensors

15
00:00:36.01 --> 00:00:38.04
will flow through the system.

16
00:00:38.04 --> 00:00:41.09
Here, we are passing in two
tensors, adding those numbers,

17
00:00:41.09 --> 00:00:44.06
squaring them and then
outputting the result

18
00:00:44.06 --> 00:00:46.03
as another tensor.

19
00:00:46.03 --> 00:00:49.08
TensorFlow is designed to be
very generic and open-ended.

20
00:00:49.08 --> 00:00:51.07
You can define the graph of operations

21
00:00:51.07 --> 00:00:54.02
that does any calculation that you want.

22
00:00:54.02 --> 00:00:56.02
While TensorFlow is most often used

23
00:00:56.02 --> 00:00:57.08
to build deep neural networks,

24
00:00:57.08 --> 00:00:59.06
it can be used to build nearly anything

25
00:00:59.06 --> 00:01:01.03
that involves processing data

26
00:01:01.03 --> 00:01:04.01
by running a series of
mathematical operations.

27
00:01:04.01 --> 00:01:07.02
There are pros and cons
to this open-ended design.

28
00:01:07.02 --> 00:01:10.03
This design makes TensorFlow
very powerful and flexible.

29
00:01:10.03 --> 00:01:12.07
It can be adapted to do almost anything,

30
00:01:12.07 --> 00:01:14.00
but on the other hand,

31
00:01:14.00 --> 00:01:16.08
this make TensorFlow difficult
for new users to learn

32
00:01:16.08 --> 00:01:19.03
since very little is done for you.

33
00:01:19.03 --> 00:01:20.03
In this course,

34
00:01:20.03 --> 00:01:23.06
we'll focus on the most common
operations you'll need to use

35
00:01:23.06 --> 00:01:26.09
to build and deploy neural
networks with TensorFlow.

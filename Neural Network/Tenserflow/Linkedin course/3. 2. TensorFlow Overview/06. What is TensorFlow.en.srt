00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.03
- If you are new to machine learning,

2
00:00:02.03 --> 00:00:05.04
you may be wondering what
TensorFlow actually is.

3
00:00:05.04 --> 00:00:07.06
TensorFlow is a software
framework for building

4
00:00:07.06 --> 00:00:10.01
and deploying machine learning models.

5
00:00:10.01 --> 00:00:11.08
Machine learning is a different approach

6
00:00:11.08 --> 00:00:13.08
than traditional programming.

7
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:15.02
With traditional programming,

8
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:17.00
we write the program
that tells the computer

9
00:00:17.00 --> 00:00:20.03
exactly what to do to complete the task.

10
00:00:20.03 --> 00:00:22.02
With machine learning, we don't explicitly

11
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:24.02
tell the computer how to do something.

12
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:26.02
Instead we show a training data

13
00:00:26.02 --> 00:00:28.06
and the machine learning
algorithm uses the training data

14
00:00:28.06 --> 00:00:31.07
that come up with its own
rules to complete the task.

15
00:00:31.07 --> 00:00:34.00
Developed at Google,
TensorFlow was designed

16
00:00:34.00 --> 00:00:36.03
to be a common platform for
building machine learning

17
00:00:36.03 --> 00:00:38.03
applications internally.

18
00:00:38.03 --> 00:00:41.01
In late 2015, they decided
to share it with the world

19
00:00:41.01 --> 00:00:43.09
and release it as an
open source application.

20
00:00:43.09 --> 00:00:46.05
TensorFlow is licensed
under the Apache open source

21
00:00:46.05 --> 00:00:48.00
software license.

22
00:00:48.00 --> 00:00:50.08
That means you can use it,
modify it, and even redistribute

23
00:00:50.08 --> 00:00:52.05
modified version of it.

24
00:00:52.05 --> 00:00:55.09
You don't have to pay any
licensing fees to use TensorFlow.

25
00:00:55.09 --> 00:00:58.00
TensorFlow gives you the
basic building blocks

26
00:00:58.00 --> 00:00:59.09
that you need to design, train,

27
00:00:59.09 --> 00:01:02.02
and deploy machine learning models.

28
00:01:02.02 --> 00:01:04.01
While it's flexible enough
to be used for several

29
00:01:04.01 --> 00:01:06.04
different types of machine
learning types of algorithms,

30
00:01:06.04 --> 00:01:09.08
it's typically used to
build deep neural networks.

31
00:01:09.08 --> 00:01:11.05
Deep neural networks built with TensorFlow

32
00:01:11.05 --> 00:01:14.01
are used in many different areas like

33
00:01:14.01 --> 00:01:15.08
image recognition, where you recognize

34
00:01:15.08 --> 00:01:17.07
what objects appear in a picture.

35
00:01:17.07 --> 00:01:19.01
Speech recognition

36
00:01:19.01 --> 00:01:21.02
where you turn speech into text.

37
00:01:21.02 --> 00:01:22.06
Image style transfer

38
00:01:22.06 --> 00:01:24.06
where you can make a photograph
look like it was painted

39
00:01:24.06 --> 00:01:26.05
in the style of a famous artist,

40
00:01:26.05 --> 00:01:27.07
or language translation

41
00:01:27.07 --> 00:01:29.01
where you translate
from one human language

42
00:01:29.01 --> 00:01:30.05
to another.

43
00:01:30.05 --> 00:01:31.08
In this particular course,

44
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:34.07
we'll use TensorFlow to solve
a typical business problem

45
00:01:34.07 --> 00:01:36.01
estimating sales.

46
00:01:36.01 --> 00:01:37.07
We'll build a basic neural network

47
00:01:37.07 --> 00:01:40.00
that can estimate the
sales of a new video game

48
00:01:40.00 --> 00:01:41.04
based on sales of past video games

49
00:01:41.04 --> 00:01:43.05
with similar characteristics.

50
00:01:43.05 --> 00:01:45.04
But everything we learn
about building and deploying

51
00:01:45.04 --> 00:01:48.04
with TensorFlow works the
same way no matter what kind

52
00:01:48.04 --> 00:01:50.06
of application you are using it for.

53
00:01:50.06 --> 00:01:53.02
TensorFlow isn't the only
option for deep learning.

54
00:01:53.02 --> 00:01:54.05
TensorFlow is comparable to

55
00:01:54.05 --> 00:01:56.05
other deep learning frameworks like

56
00:01:56.05 --> 00:01:59.02
Theano, Torch, and Pytorch.

57
00:01:59.02 --> 00:02:01.04
Each framework has its own pros and cons,

58
00:02:01.04 --> 00:02:03.07
but all of them are popular
within different research groups

59
00:02:03.07 --> 00:02:05.01
and companies.

60
00:02:05.01 --> 00:02:07.01
It's common for a machine
learning researcher

61
00:02:07.01 --> 00:02:09.03
to be familiar with several of them.

62
00:02:09.03 --> 00:02:11.04
Since TensorFlow was Google solution,

63
00:02:11.04 --> 00:02:13.02
Google has helped promote
it, and its become

64
00:02:13.02 --> 00:02:15.00
one of the more popular choices.

65
00:02:15.00 --> 00:02:16.09
It also works well with
many Google products

66
00:02:16.09 --> 00:02:18.08
like their Cloud ML platform

67
00:02:18.08 --> 00:02:20.04
and for deploying machine learning models

68
00:02:20.04 --> 00:02:22.05
and Android mobile phones.

69
00:02:22.05 --> 00:02:24.05
TensorFlow is a low level toolkit.

70
00:02:24.05 --> 00:02:26.00
It can take quite a few lines of code

71
00:02:26.00 --> 00:02:28.07
to build a machine learning
model in TensorFlow.

72
00:02:28.07 --> 00:02:30.06
Because of this, there are
wrappers for TensorFlow

73
00:02:30.06 --> 00:02:33.01
that simplify common operations.

74
00:02:33.01 --> 00:02:36.01
The most popular wrapper
for TensorFlow is Keras.

75
00:02:36.01 --> 00:02:38.06
Keras is a high level programming toolkit

76
00:02:38.06 --> 00:02:40.06
that makes it easy to
build many different types

77
00:02:40.06 --> 00:02:43.04
of neural networks with
only a few lines of code.

78
00:02:43.04 --> 00:02:45.04
Keras still uses TensorFlow
behind the scenes

79
00:02:45.04 --> 00:02:47.02
to actually do the processing.

80
00:02:47.02 --> 00:02:49.00
It's a great choice if you
don't need the low level

81
00:02:49.00 --> 00:02:51.04
flexibility of TensorFlow.

82
00:02:51.04 --> 00:02:53.08
My recommendation is to
learn how to use TensorFlow

83
00:02:53.08 --> 00:02:56.00
on its own first, to
make sure you understand

84
00:02:56.00 --> 00:02:58.00
what's going on behind the scenes.

85
00:02:58.00 --> 00:02:59.07
But once you're familiar with TensorFlow,

86
00:02:59.07 --> 00:03:02.00
it's great to also learn how to use Keras.

87
00:03:02.00 --> 00:03:04.02
It makes many common tasks much easier

88
00:03:04.02 --> 00:03:06.03
and it can be a great time saver.

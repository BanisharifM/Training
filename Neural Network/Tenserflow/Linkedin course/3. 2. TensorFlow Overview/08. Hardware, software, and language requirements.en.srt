00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:01.03
- [Instructor] Let's talk about

2
00:00:01.03 --> 00:00:03.09
the tangibles you need to get started.

3
00:00:03.09 --> 00:00:07.00
TensorFlow has different hardware
and software requirements

4
00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:10.04
for the development phase
and the runtime phase.

5
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:13.00
The Development phase is
when you are first coding

6
00:00:13.00 --> 00:00:15.03
and then training a neural network.

7
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:18.06
This is usually done on your own computer.

8
00:00:18.06 --> 00:00:22.00
The Runtime phase, also
called the inference phase,

9
00:00:22.00 --> 00:00:24.02
is when you are using a
trained neural network

10
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:25.09
to make predictions.

11
00:00:25.09 --> 00:00:29.02
This might be done on your own
computer, on a cloud server,

12
00:00:29.02 --> 00:00:32.03
or on a user's computer, or mobile device.

13
00:00:32.03 --> 00:00:33.03
When you are developing

14
00:00:33.03 --> 00:00:35.04
machine learning models with TensorFlow,

15
00:00:35.04 --> 00:00:39.08
you need a computer running
Windows, macOS, or Linux.

16
00:00:39.08 --> 00:00:41.09
For very large projects
you might take advantage

17
00:00:41.09 --> 00:00:44.05
of multiple Linux computers in the cloud

18
00:00:44.05 --> 00:00:46.04
to speed up processing.

19
00:00:46.04 --> 00:00:48.01
But once you have a trained model

20
00:00:48.01 --> 00:00:49.05
you can run it on a wider range

21
00:00:49.05 --> 00:00:52.02
of computers and hardware devices.

22
00:00:52.02 --> 00:00:53.07
You can run your trained models

23
00:00:53.07 --> 00:00:56.08
on Mac, Windows, and Linux desktops,

24
00:00:56.08 --> 00:00:58.09
as a web service on Linux servers

25
00:00:58.09 --> 00:01:02.02
using the TensorFlow Serving application,

26
00:01:02.02 --> 00:01:05.06
in the cloud with
Google's Cloud ML service,

27
00:01:05.06 --> 00:01:08.07
and on iOS or Android mobile devices.

28
00:01:08.07 --> 00:01:11.02
The flexibility to run the
same machine learning model

29
00:01:11.02 --> 00:01:12.07
on many different platforms

30
00:01:12.07 --> 00:01:15.02
is one of the best features of TensorFlow.

31
00:01:15.02 --> 00:01:17.03
TensorFlow can take
advantage of video cards

32
00:01:17.03 --> 00:01:20.03
with GPUs, or graphics processing units,

33
00:01:20.03 --> 00:01:22.04
to speed up training.

34
00:01:22.04 --> 00:01:24.02
GPUs are chips originally designed

35
00:01:24.02 --> 00:01:26.04
to speed up 3D video games

36
00:01:26.04 --> 00:01:28.09
but they are also good at
the algebraic calculations

37
00:01:28.09 --> 00:01:31.04
needed to train neural networks.

38
00:01:31.04 --> 00:01:33.03
In fact deep learning is only possible

39
00:01:33.03 --> 00:01:36.02
because GPUs let us train
large neural networks

40
00:01:36.02 --> 00:01:38.03
in a reasonable amount of time.

41
00:01:38.03 --> 00:01:39.05
Keep in mind that TensorFlow

42
00:01:39.05 --> 00:01:42.04
only supports NVIDIA-brand GPUs.

43
00:01:42.04 --> 00:01:43.09
Video cards with GPUs produced

44
00:01:43.09 --> 00:01:46.06
by other vendors won't
work with TensorFlow.

45
00:01:46.06 --> 00:01:47.07
You won't need a video card

46
00:01:47.07 --> 00:01:50.03
with a GPU to complete this class.

47
00:01:50.03 --> 00:01:53.08
But having one is helpful when
working on large projects.

48
00:01:53.08 --> 00:01:55.09
Using a GPU can reduce the time needed

49
00:01:55.09 --> 00:01:59.06
to train a large neural
network from days to minutes.

50
00:01:59.06 --> 00:02:01.02
Using a GPU with TensorFlow

51
00:02:01.02 --> 00:02:03.06
requires installing
additional software libraries

52
00:02:03.06 --> 00:02:06.04
from NVIDIA that aren't open source.

53
00:02:06.04 --> 00:02:09.03
Just installing TensorFlow
on its own won't be enough

54
00:02:09.03 --> 00:02:11.08
to take advantage of a GPU.

55
00:02:11.08 --> 00:02:13.09
TensorFlow's core execution engine

56
00:02:13.09 --> 00:02:16.01
is written in C++ for speed.

57
00:02:16.01 --> 00:02:19.01
But C++ can be a cumbersome
language to work with.

58
00:02:19.01 --> 00:02:20.08
To make things easier TensorFlow

59
00:02:20.08 --> 00:02:24.04
lets other programming
languages control the C++ core.

60
00:02:24.04 --> 00:02:25.04
The best supported language

61
00:02:25.04 --> 00:02:27.07
for TensorFlow development is Python.

62
00:02:27.07 --> 00:02:29.06
Python is a high level
programming language

63
00:02:29.06 --> 00:02:32.09
that is easy to learn
and quick to develop in.

64
00:02:32.09 --> 00:02:34.03
The main downside of using Python

65
00:02:34.03 --> 00:02:36.06
is that it is relatively slow to execute

66
00:02:36.06 --> 00:02:40.02
compared to a low level
language like C or C++.

67
00:02:40.02 --> 00:02:42.05
But TensorFlow works around this problem.

68
00:02:42.05 --> 00:02:44.02
Your Python code defines the structure

69
00:02:44.02 --> 00:02:45.09
of your machine learning model

70
00:02:45.09 --> 00:02:48.04
but TensorFlow's high
performance execution engine

71
00:02:48.04 --> 00:02:50.03
actually pushes data through the model

72
00:02:50.03 --> 00:02:54.03
and performs all the mathematical
operations using C++.

73
00:02:54.03 --> 00:02:56.01
Since all the heavy lifting happens inside

74
00:02:56.01 --> 00:02:58.00
the high performance execution engine

75
00:02:58.00 --> 00:03:00.01
you still get great performance.

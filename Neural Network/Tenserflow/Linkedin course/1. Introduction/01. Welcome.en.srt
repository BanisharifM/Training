00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:01.08
- [Instructor] Do you
want to learn how to use

2
00:00:01.08 --> 00:00:04.03
deep learning in your applications?

3
00:00:04.03 --> 00:00:07.00
Google's TensorFlow is one
of the most popular tools

4
00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:08.06
for deep learning.

5
00:00:08.06 --> 00:00:10.04
With TensorFlow, you can build your own

6
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:12.04
state-of-the-art machine learning systems

7
00:00:12.04 --> 00:00:15.02
and use them to power
your own applications.

8
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:16.08
Hi, I'm Adam Geitgey.

9
00:00:16.08 --> 00:00:19.03
In this course, we will
learn how to use TensorFlow

10
00:00:19.03 --> 00:00:22.04
to build and deploy
machine learning models.

11
00:00:22.04 --> 00:00:25.00
First, we will cover how
to get TensorFlow installed

12
00:00:25.00 --> 00:00:26.07
and running on your system.

13
00:00:26.07 --> 00:00:29.01
Then, we will explore
how to create and train

14
00:00:29.01 --> 00:00:31.09
a machine learning model in TensorFlow.

15
00:00:31.09 --> 00:00:34.04
Next, we will use TensorFlow's
visualization tools

16
00:00:34.04 --> 00:00:37.07
to analyze and improve our
machine learning model.

17
00:00:37.07 --> 00:00:39.06
Finally we will deploy
the model to the cloud

18
00:00:39.06 --> 00:00:42.04
where we can call it from any program.

19
00:00:42.04 --> 00:00:44.05
If you want to learn how to
incorporate machine learning

20
00:00:44.05 --> 00:00:46.02
methods in your own applications,

21
00:00:46.02 --> 00:00:48.02
this is the right place to start.

22
00:00:48.02 --> 00:00:49.03
Let's dive in.

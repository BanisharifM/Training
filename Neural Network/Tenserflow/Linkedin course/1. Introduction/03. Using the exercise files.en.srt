00:00:00.07 --> 00:00:02.06
- [Instructor] If you have
access to the exercise files

2
00:00:02.06 --> 00:00:05.01
for this course, you can
download them to your desktop

3
00:00:05.01 --> 00:00:09.01
as I've done here.

4
00:00:09.01 --> 00:00:11.02
The files are organized by chapter.

5
00:00:11.02 --> 00:00:13.01
All the code and data used in each video

6
00:00:13.01 --> 00:00:14.09
can be found in the corresponding folder

7
00:00:14.09 --> 00:00:17.02
based on the chapter name.

8
00:00:17.02 --> 00:00:19.01
Each example program has an initial state

9
00:00:19.01 --> 00:00:21.01
and a final state.

10
00:00:21.01 --> 00:00:23.02
If you're viewing this
course on a mobile device

11
00:00:23.02 --> 00:00:25.08
a settop device or your
membership doesn't provide

12
00:00:25.08 --> 00:00:27.02
access to the exercise files,

13
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:29.03
that's okay, you can still follow along

14
00:00:29.03 --> 00:00:31.07
by watching how I use the files.

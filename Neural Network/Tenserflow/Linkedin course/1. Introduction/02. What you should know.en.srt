00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.03
- [Instructor] Before
starting this course,

2
00:00:02.03 --> 00:00:05.02
it will be helpful to have
some programming experience.

3
00:00:05.02 --> 00:00:07.04
The examples are written in Python 3,

4
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:09.00
so it's also helpful if you have

5
00:00:09.00 --> 00:00:12.03
some familiarity with Python syntax.

6
00:00:12.03 --> 00:00:13.09
Regardless, I'll explain things

7
00:00:13.09 --> 00:00:15.06
in the way that will be accessible,

8
00:00:15.06 --> 00:00:18.07
even if you don't have a
lot of experience in Python.

9
00:00:18.07 --> 00:00:20.05
Also, it will be helpful if you have

10
00:00:20.05 --> 00:00:22.07
some basic experience
with machine learning.

11
00:00:22.07 --> 00:00:24.05
If you're brand new to machine learning,

12
00:00:24.05 --> 00:00:27.04
you can check out machine
learning courses in the library.

1
00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.08
- To work with the code
examples in this course,

2
00:00:02.08 --> 00:00:05.08
we need to install the Python
3 programming language,

3
00:00:05.08 --> 00:00:07.08
the PyCharm development environment,

4
00:00:07.08 --> 00:00:11.03
and several software libraries
including TensorFlow.

5
00:00:11.03 --> 00:00:13.07
This video will cover
installation on Windows.

6
00:00:13.07 --> 00:00:15.05
If you're using Mac OS, watch the separate

7
00:00:15.05 --> 00:00:19.00
video covering Mac installation instead.

8
00:00:19.00 --> 00:00:21.04
The method we'll use to install
TensorFlow in this video

9
00:00:21.04 --> 00:00:25.00
will only install the
core TensorFlow libraries.

10
00:00:25.00 --> 00:00:27.02
It won't install the
additional components needed

11
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:28.08
to take advantage of a video card's

12
00:00:28.08 --> 00:00:31.09
GPU to accelerate processing.

13
00:00:31.09 --> 00:00:34.05
Using a GPU requires special hardware

14
00:00:34.05 --> 00:00:37.00
and won't be needed for this course,

15
00:00:37.00 --> 00:00:39.01
but if you would like to
install TensorFlow with

16
00:00:39.01 --> 00:00:42.01
GPU support, please refer to
the more detailed instructions

17
00:00:42.01 --> 00:00:44.09
on the TensorFlow website
for the additional steps

18
00:00:44.09 --> 00:00:46.02
you'll need to follow.

19
00:00:46.02 --> 00:00:49.02
First, let's install Python 3.

20
00:00:49.02 --> 00:00:51.00
On Windows, we'll be using the Anaconda

21
00:00:51.00 --> 00:00:53.03
distribution of Python.

22
00:00:53.03 --> 00:00:55.00
Many Python machine learning libraries

23
00:00:55.00 --> 00:00:56.06
were first developed for Linux,

24
00:00:56.06 --> 00:00:59.06
and they can be difficult to
install correctly on Windows.

25
00:00:59.06 --> 00:01:02.00
Anaconda provides pre-packaged versions of

26
00:01:02.00 --> 00:01:03.08
Python machine learning libraries,

27
00:01:03.08 --> 00:01:07.01
which makes installation
on Windows a lot easier.

28
00:01:07.01 --> 00:01:09.03
We're at the continuum.io website.

29
00:01:09.03 --> 00:01:12.04
Click download Anaconda.

30
00:01:12.04 --> 00:01:13.07
Since we're using Windows,

31
00:01:13.07 --> 00:01:16.00
we'll choose to download
the Windows version.

32
00:01:16.00 --> 00:01:17.02
Click.

33
00:01:17.02 --> 00:01:20.04
Now we have the choice
between Python 3 and Python 2.

34
00:01:20.04 --> 00:01:24.00
Click to download Python 3.

35
00:01:24.00 --> 00:01:25.04
Now that the download is finished,

36
00:01:25.04 --> 00:01:29.09
let's launch the installer.

37
00:01:29.09 --> 00:01:31.06
Click run.

38
00:01:31.06 --> 00:01:34.04
We can accept all the default options.

39
00:01:34.04 --> 00:01:37.08
Next.

40
00:01:37.08 --> 00:01:39.09
And install.

41
00:01:39.09 --> 00:01:41.04
When we downloaded Anaconda,

42
00:01:41.04 --> 00:01:44.07
we had the choice between
Python 2 and Python 3.

43
00:01:44.07 --> 00:01:46.08
Python 3 is the newer version of Python

44
00:01:46.08 --> 00:01:48.05
that has several nice improvements,

45
00:01:48.05 --> 00:01:49.07
like better support for working

46
00:01:49.07 --> 00:01:51.03
with texts in other languages.

47
00:01:51.03 --> 00:01:52.07
So that's what we'll use for this course,

48
00:01:52.07 --> 00:01:55.03
and what I'd recommend you
use for your own projects,

49
00:01:55.03 --> 00:01:57.01
but sometimes you might see code online

50
00:01:57.01 --> 00:02:00.02
written for Python 2 that hasn't
been updated for Python 3.

51
00:02:00.02 --> 00:02:02.00
In that case, you can install

52
00:02:02.00 --> 00:02:03.09
Python 2 using the same process.

53
00:02:03.09 --> 00:02:08.04
You can have both versions
installed at the same time.

54
00:02:08.04 --> 00:02:09.09
Great, the installation is complete.

55
00:02:09.09 --> 00:02:11.07
Click Next,

56
00:02:11.07 --> 00:02:12.05
and uncheck,

57
00:02:12.05 --> 00:02:14.04
and Finish.

58
00:02:14.04 --> 00:02:16.02
Now we need to install PyCharm.

59
00:02:16.02 --> 00:02:19.07
PyCharm is an integrated
development environment for Python.

60
00:02:19.07 --> 00:02:22.07
Go to jetbrains.com/PyCharm.

61
00:02:22.07 --> 00:02:25.09
Okay, click Download Now,

62
00:02:25.09 --> 00:02:28.05
and then make sure you've
chosen the Windows version.

63
00:02:28.05 --> 00:02:30.08
We have the choice of
downloading the community edition

64
00:02:30.08 --> 00:02:32.06
or the professional edition.

65
00:02:32.06 --> 00:02:34.09
Either will work, but the
community edition is free

66
00:02:34.09 --> 00:02:36.05
and has all the features we need,

67
00:02:36.05 --> 00:02:39.02
so let's download the community edition.

68
00:02:39.02 --> 00:02:42.02
Click.

69
00:02:42.02 --> 00:02:45.07
Alright, click and launch the installer.

70
00:02:45.07 --> 00:02:48.04
Click Run.

71
00:02:48.04 --> 00:02:49.08
We can accept all the defaults.

72
00:02:49.08 --> 00:02:51.02
Click Next,

73
00:02:51.02 --> 00:02:53.03
and Next,

74
00:02:53.03 --> 00:02:57.00
and Install.

75
00:02:57.00 --> 00:02:58.00
Great, it's done.

76
00:02:58.00 --> 00:03:01.06
Let's click to run PyCharm, and Finish.

77
00:03:01.06 --> 00:03:03.00
The first time we launch PyCharm,

78
00:03:03.00 --> 00:03:04.05
it'll ask us some questions.

79
00:03:04.05 --> 00:03:07.06
We can just accept the defaults,

80
00:03:07.06 --> 00:03:10.09
and click Accept,

81
00:03:10.09 --> 00:03:12.08
and OK.

82
00:03:12.08 --> 00:03:14.07
Now we are ready to create a project.

83
00:03:14.07 --> 00:03:17.05
Click Create New Project.

84
00:03:17.05 --> 00:03:19.07
When we create the project,
choose the folder where you've

85
00:03:19.07 --> 00:03:24.08
downloaded the exercise files
if you have them available.

86
00:03:24.08 --> 00:03:25.08
Okay.

87
00:03:25.08 --> 00:03:28.04
Next we need to configure
the Python interpreter.

88
00:03:28.04 --> 00:03:33.08
By default, Anaconda has
installed 3.6 for us here.

89
00:03:33.08 --> 00:03:36.03
But currently, TensorFlow
on Windows only works

90
00:03:36.03 --> 00:03:39.06
with Python 3.5, so we need
to install that as well.

91
00:03:39.06 --> 00:03:41.01
Click on the gear icon,

92
00:03:41.01 --> 00:03:44.01
and click Create Conda Environment.

93
00:03:44.01 --> 00:03:47.06
For the name, let's call it TensorFlow.

94
00:03:47.06 --> 00:03:51.02
For the Python version,
make sure you've chosen 3.5,

95
00:03:51.02 --> 00:03:53.02
and then click OK.

96
00:03:53.02 --> 00:03:58.02
Now PyCharm will configure
Python 3.5 for us.

97
00:03:58.02 --> 00:04:01.00
Okay, now click Create.

98
00:04:01.00 --> 00:04:05.01
And then click Yes to confirm.

99
00:04:05.01 --> 00:04:06.07
And close.

100
00:04:06.07 --> 00:04:09.03
Before we continue, we need
to take a little detour

101
00:04:09.03 --> 00:04:11.04
to manually install TensorFlow.

102
00:04:11.04 --> 00:04:13.05
Because of the way it's
distributed for Windows,

103
00:04:13.05 --> 00:04:15.08
we need to install it
from the command line.

104
00:04:15.08 --> 00:04:18.00
To do that, let's open up the search bar

105
00:04:18.00 --> 00:04:23.00
and run the Anaconda Prompt application.

106
00:04:23.00 --> 00:04:24.08
Now we are at a Command Prompt.

107
00:04:24.08 --> 00:04:28.01
The first step is to activate
the Python 3.5 environment

108
00:04:28.01 --> 00:04:29.08
that we just created so that TensorFlow

109
00:04:29.08 --> 00:04:32.00
gets installed into the correct place.

110
00:04:32.00 --> 00:04:37.04
To do that, type "activate
TensorFlow" and hit enter.

111
00:04:37.04 --> 00:04:39.04
Now we're ready to install TensorFlow.

112
00:04:39.04 --> 00:04:40.07
The easiest way to do this is to

113
00:04:40.07 --> 00:04:43.05
cut and paste the command
from the TensorFlow website.

114
00:04:43.05 --> 00:04:45.09
Let's go back to the TensorFlow website,

115
00:04:45.09 --> 00:04:47.09
click on Install,

116
00:04:47.09 --> 00:04:49.01
and then we're going to click

117
00:04:49.01 --> 00:04:51.08
Installing TensorFlow on Windows,

118
00:04:51.08 --> 00:04:54.09
and then we're going to scroll down until

119
00:04:54.09 --> 00:04:59.09
we get to the section that
says Installing with Anaconda,

120
00:04:59.09 --> 00:05:02.09
and then finally we're going to
copy the command from number 4,

121
00:05:02.09 --> 00:05:05.09
under installing the CPU-only
version of TensorFlow.

122
00:05:05.09 --> 00:05:07.02
So I'm going to cut and paste this command

123
00:05:07.02 --> 00:05:11.06
into the Command Prompt application.

124
00:05:11.06 --> 00:05:12.09
Control + C,

125
00:05:12.09 --> 00:05:15.02
and then now I'm going to
tap the Command Prompt,

126
00:05:15.02 --> 00:05:20.02
and then right click
to paste and hit Enter.

127
00:05:20.02 --> 00:05:22.09
Great, when it says everything
was successfully isntalled,

128
00:05:22.09 --> 00:05:25.07
you can close the Command Prompt window.

129
00:05:25.07 --> 00:05:28.04
Now let's switch back to PyCharm.

130
00:05:28.04 --> 00:05:30.06
Let's open up one of the
source files in PyCharm.

131
00:05:30.06 --> 00:05:32.04
Click on Exercise Files,

132
00:05:32.04 --> 00:05:37.00
and 02, and addition final.py.

133
00:05:37.00 --> 00:05:39.00
As soon as we open the
file, PyCharm will tell us

134
00:05:39.00 --> 00:05:42.01
that some of the package
requirements are still missing.

135
00:05:42.01 --> 00:05:43.05
These are the other
machine learning libraries

136
00:05:43.05 --> 00:05:45.01
we'll be using in the course.

137
00:05:45.01 --> 00:05:47.06
Click Install requirements,

138
00:05:47.06 --> 00:05:50.01
and then click Install.

139
00:05:50.01 --> 00:05:52.02
You might receive this
error that says the package

140
00:05:52.02 --> 00:05:55.06
google-api-python-client is not satisfied.

141
00:05:55.06 --> 00:05:58.07
That's okay, we can work around this.

142
00:05:58.07 --> 00:06:00.02
First, let's use the search bar

143
00:06:00.02 --> 00:06:04.04
to open up the Anaconda prompt again.

144
00:06:04.04 --> 00:06:08.05
Next, let's type "activate TensorFlow,"

145
00:06:08.05 --> 00:06:10.02
and hit Enter.

146
00:06:10.02 --> 00:06:13.03
Then we can manually install
the package with this command,

147
00:06:13.03 --> 00:06:22.01
"conda install -c conda-forge,"

148
00:06:22.01 --> 00:06:23.06
and then the name of the package,

149
00:06:23.06 --> 00:06:28.05
which is google-api-python-client.

150
00:06:28.05 --> 00:06:30.07
Then hit Enter.

151
00:06:30.07 --> 00:06:34.02
Then hit Enter to proceed.

152
00:06:34.02 --> 00:06:36.05
Great, now everything is ready to go.

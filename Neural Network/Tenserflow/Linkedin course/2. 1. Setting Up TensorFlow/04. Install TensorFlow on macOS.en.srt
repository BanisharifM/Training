1
00:00:00.08 --> 00:00:03.00
- To work with the code
examples in this course,

2
00:00:03.00 --> 00:00:05.07
we need to install the Python
3 programming language,

3
00:00:05.07 --> 00:00:08.03
the PyCharm development environment,

4
00:00:08.03 --> 00:00:12.03
and several software libraries,
including TensorFlow.

5
00:00:12.03 --> 00:00:15.06
This video will cover
installation on Mac OS.

6
00:00:15.06 --> 00:00:18.01
If you are using Windows,
watch the separate video

7
00:00:18.01 --> 00:00:20.05
covering Windows installation instead.

8
00:00:20.05 --> 00:00:22.05
The method we'll use to install TensorFlow

9
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:25.03
will only install the
core TensorFlow libraries.

10
00:00:25.03 --> 00:00:27.05
It won't install the
additional components needed

11
00:00:27.05 --> 00:00:30.01
to take advantage of the video card's GPU

12
00:00:30.01 --> 00:00:32.03
to accelerate processing.

13
00:00:32.03 --> 00:00:34.08
Using a GPU requires special hardware

14
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:37.02
that won't be needed for this course,

15
00:00:37.02 --> 00:00:38.09
but if you would like
to install TensorFlow

16
00:00:38.09 --> 00:00:40.07
with GPU support, please refer

17
00:00:40.07 --> 00:00:43.01
to the more detailed
installation instructions

18
00:00:43.01 --> 00:00:44.06
on the TensorFlow website

19
00:00:44.06 --> 00:00:47.01
for the additional steps
you need to follow.

20
00:00:47.01 --> 00:00:48.05
Okay, let's get to it.

21
00:00:48.05 --> 00:00:51.08
First, let's install Python 3.

22
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:54.01
We're at the python.org website.

23
00:00:54.01 --> 00:00:58.08
At the top of the page,
click on Downloads.

24
00:00:58.08 --> 00:01:00.03
Now, we'll see the newest version

25
00:01:00.03 --> 00:01:02.09
of Python 3 available for Mac OS.

26
00:01:02.09 --> 00:01:06.01
Click to download Python 3.

27
00:01:06.01 --> 00:01:09.05
Click on the downloaded file
to launch the installer.

28
00:01:09.05 --> 00:01:13.02
We can accept all the default options.

29
00:01:13.02 --> 00:01:16.06
Mac OS actually comes with
Python 2 already installed,

30
00:01:16.06 --> 00:01:19.01
but Python 3 is the
current version of Python,

31
00:01:19.01 --> 00:01:21.00
and it has several nice improvements,

32
00:01:21.00 --> 00:01:22.05
like improved support for working

33
00:01:22.05 --> 00:01:24.04
with text in different languages.

34
00:01:24.04 --> 00:01:26.02
Either version can be
used for machine learning,

35
00:01:26.02 --> 00:01:29.05
but there's no reason not
to use the latest version.

36
00:01:29.05 --> 00:01:33.01
Great, the installation is complete.

37
00:01:33.01 --> 00:01:35.02
Next, we need to install PyCharm.

38
00:01:35.02 --> 00:01:38.07
PyCharm is an integrated
development environment for Python.

39
00:01:38.07 --> 00:01:43.00
Let's go to jetbrains.com/pycharm.

40
00:01:43.00 --> 00:01:46.04
Okay, click Download Now,

41
00:01:46.04 --> 00:01:50.01
and we'll choose the Mac version
which is already selected.

42
00:01:50.01 --> 00:01:52.07
We now have the choice of
downloading the community edition

43
00:01:52.07 --> 00:01:54.07
or the professional edition.

44
00:01:54.07 --> 00:01:57.01
Either will work, but the
community edition is free

45
00:01:57.01 --> 00:01:59.00
and has all the features we need.

46
00:01:59.00 --> 00:02:05.02
So let's download the community edition.

47
00:02:05.02 --> 00:02:10.06
When the download completes,
click on the file to open it.

48
00:02:10.06 --> 00:02:12.07
To install it, just drag the application

49
00:02:12.07 --> 00:02:16.08
to the applications folder.

50
00:02:16.08 --> 00:02:23.09
Now, let's run PyCharm from
the applications folder,

51
00:02:23.09 --> 00:02:27.06
and click Open.

52
00:02:27.06 --> 00:02:29.03
The first time we launch PyCharm,

53
00:02:29.03 --> 00:02:31.01
it will ask us some questions.

54
00:02:31.01 --> 00:02:36.05
We can just accept the
defaults and move forward.

55
00:02:36.05 --> 00:02:38.08
Now we are ready to create a new project.

56
00:02:38.08 --> 00:02:41.05
Click Create New Project.

57
00:02:41.05 --> 00:02:43.04
When you create the
project, choose the folder

58
00:02:43.04 --> 00:02:45.05
where you have downloaded
the exercise files,

59
00:02:45.05 --> 00:02:48.04
if you have them available.

60
00:02:48.04 --> 00:02:50.09
For the interpreter, choose
the version of Python 3

61
00:02:50.09 --> 00:02:52.08
that you've just installed.

62
00:02:52.08 --> 00:02:55.09
It will probably be selected by default,

63
00:02:55.09 --> 00:02:57.09
and click Create.

64
00:02:57.09 --> 00:02:59.05
It will pop up a dialogue that tells us

65
00:02:59.05 --> 00:03:01.01
that the files already exist.

66
00:03:01.01 --> 00:03:03.09
Just click Yes,

67
00:03:03.09 --> 00:03:06.04
and you can close the tool tip window.

68
00:03:06.04 --> 00:03:09.07
Now, let's open one of the exercise files.

69
00:03:09.07 --> 00:03:15.02
I'll click on 02, and
click on Edition Final.

70
00:03:15.02 --> 00:03:16.08
As soon as we try to open the file,

71
00:03:16.08 --> 00:03:17.07
PyCharm will tell us

72
00:03:17.07 --> 00:03:21.04
that some package requirements
are missing at the top.

73
00:03:21.04 --> 00:03:24.03
Click Install Requirements,

74
00:03:24.03 --> 00:03:26.09
and then click Install to confirm.

75
00:03:26.09 --> 00:03:29.01
Depending on the version
of Mac OS you are using,

76
00:03:29.01 --> 00:03:31.02
this process may take quite a bit of time.

77
00:03:31.02 --> 00:03:32.07
If there's no pre-compiled version

78
00:03:32.07 --> 00:03:35.00
of scikit-learn available for your OS,

79
00:03:35.00 --> 00:03:37.00
you'll have to recompile from scratch,

80
00:03:37.00 --> 00:03:38.08
but just let it run until it's done.

81
00:03:38.08 --> 00:03:42.01
You can monitor the progress
in the bar at the bottom.

82
00:03:42.01 --> 00:03:44.03
Great, we are ready to get started.
